# JunkSmash @ Synt-Hacks Hackathon

Prize: Runners Up in the Hackathon

Made a unity based game called JunkSmash that made the user fight against junk food items like pizza. The app made an effort to use psychology/experiential learning to spread social awareness of junk food through the game to the user playing it. Made the game as a part of the Synt-Hacks hackathon at high school and came 2nd in the hackathon.
